* At VMworld 2013 vCOps 5.8 was announced. There seem to be some pretty cool
    features in there. Eric Shanks at The IT Hollow has [a great break down on
    the new features](http://theithollow.com/2013/10/vmware-vcops-5-8-announced/).

* By default you can’t really get data out of vCOps but there is a
    [community PowerShell module](http://velemental.com/2012/09/04/unofficial-vmware-vcenter-operations-powershell-module/)
    to allow you to get the stats out. [Brian Wuchner over at
    EnterpriseAdmins.org shows how to use it](http://enterpriseadmins.org/blog/scripting/getting-data-out-of-vcops/).

* Moving into the world of SCOM, 2012 R2 the venerable SCOM Agent is being
    renamed Microsoft Monitoring Agent. There are a couple of new features in
    the new agent but nothing earth shattering, to me. Marnix Wolf [has the
    breakdown and a great side by side comparison chart](http://thoughtsonopsmgr.blogspot.nl/2013/09/scom-2012-r2-hello-mma-microsoft.html).

* If you are doing an upgrade to 2012 R2 there are a few things you need to
    be aware of and Marnix again [has all the answers](http://thoughtsonopsmgr.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/scom-2012-r2-scom-2012-sp1-scom-2012.html).
    What surprised me is the compatibility between the different agent
    versions.

* The Cisco Security blog has a post on [a topic everyone loves, logs](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/making-boring-logs-interesting/)!
    The title is “Making Boring Logs Interesting”, I’m sure they mean
    interesting as in useful and not to make it an interesting read. Maybe…
