- Anthony Burke over at Cisco Inferno has [a good blog post on what he believes the
  current state of play is with NSX](http://blog.ciscoinferno.net/vmware-nsx-is-here-and-now).
  After reading it I have to agree. I believe that to reach any kind of scale we
  need tech like NSX. Overlays are here to stay.
- Scott Lowe has a [great blog series on NSX](http://blog.scottlowe.org/2013/11/01/learning-nvp-part-7-handling-the-nvp-to-nsx-transition/)
  (was NVP when it was Nicira) that I believe is a must read. Don't worry about
  skipping ahead to part 7, it has links back to the previous articles.
- I have to admit that when NSX was talked about at VMworld the marketing message
  put me offside, the belief that decades of evolving network "art" should be
  thrown out the window because a single company said so looked pretty delusional.
  Thankfully the strength of the product and some blog posts by credible networking
  professionals allowed me to see through the marketing fog to see the "next
  generation" product that NSX really is. [With that in mind Paul Fries talks
  about the alienation of networking](http://www.poppingclouds.com/2013/10/03/nsx-alienating-networking-team/)
  that I believe is purely a function of poor marketing. I would like to differ
  on one point however, the networking industry has been in a constant state of
  change for a long time, it just doesn't come in a 2.0 release nor for the whole
  industry at once.
- I can't really add anything to this one. James over at Digerati has [a must read
  post on NSX, SDN and SDDC](http://blog.digerati.me/vmware-nsx-and-the-sddc-revolution/).
- If you are up for a bit of listening that I would highly recommend [the Packet
  Pushers NSX sponsored podcast](http://packetpushers.net/show-161-vmware-nsx-real-world-sdn-sponsored/).
  They have Scott Lowe and Brad Hedlund on so you know it is going to be great.
  There is even a companion PDF!
