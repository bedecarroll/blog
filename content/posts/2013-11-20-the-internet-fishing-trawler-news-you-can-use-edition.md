* For all you Microsoft admins out there, Redmond has release
[free ebook on Windows Server 2012 R2](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft_press/archive/2013/11/08/free-ebook-introducing-windows-server-2012-r2-technical-overview.aspx).
I haven't had a chance to look at it yet but it is free!

* Citrix have announced their EOL dates for the Citrix Web Interface products.
Get the dates and a Doctor Evil picture over [at the vCloudinfo blog](http://www.vmwareinfo.com/2013/11/citrix-web-interface-end-of-life-dates.html).

* William Lam over at virtuallyGhetto has another great blog post on
[getting nested ESXi (vInception) running on top of the new VSAN](http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2013/11/how-to-run-nested-esxi-on-top-of-vsan.html).
Because VSAN doesn't use SCSI-2 reservations, ESXi wasn't to happy about installing.
I wonder if there are any other OSes where this could be an issue?

* VMware KB 2052334 -
["Installing vCenter Server 5.5 best practices"](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2052334)
 \- is a KB you are going to want to put in your notes.

* And the best for last. It seems HP has joined us in the future by releasing a
PowerShell module for iLOs. I think it is about time and look forward to the
module improving going forward. Kyle Ruddy over at
"That... Could Be A Problem..." has
[a great post with examples and all on how to use the new module](http://thatcouldbeaproblem.com/?p=685),
well worth the read.
