- Good news everyone! F5 have dropped the price of their LTM VE lab
  editions to approx. USD$95. Here in Australia the going rate was about
  AUD$2000 so this represents a significant saving. With this price it is
  worth adding these VMs to your lab and I look forward to trying out NSX
  with these new VEs when I’m able to get ahold of NSX. I’ve bought two to
  test failover but I’m still waiting on my license keys. Unfortunately
  not all resellers have updated and the prices I have available in
  Australia are the old ones, however, Packet Pushers have [a blog post on
  where to order it](http://packetpushers.net/f5-drops-lab-ve-price-to-95/).
  The licenses are delivered digitally.

- If you need a little more guidance on where to go and how to get the
  product, Ethan Banks has [a blog post detailing the
  steps](http://ethancbanks.com/2013/12/17/how-to-obtain-install-f5-big-ip-ve-lab-edition/).

- In other Christmas present news, VMware have released pyVmomi, the
  VMware SDK for Python. William Lam over at virtuallyGhetto has [the
  great news](http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2013/12/early-xmas-gift-from-vmware-pyvmomi.html).

- Unfortunately even with all the cool Python stuff as of late I still
  haven’t had the chance to sit down and do some learning of the language.
  Thankfully Chris Wahl has [a very useful post for those looking to
  learn](http://wahlnetwork.com/2013/12/16/absolutely-can-learn-python-codecademy/).
  Lots of good information there!

- I’ll be looking to update my lab environment sooner or later but part of
  the problem is the huge number of options available! Right when you
  think a particular design looks about right, you find another option
  which requires more thinking and planning. When looking at your storage
  design I’d really recommend reading a [post by Chris Wahl on the
  various pros and cons of each storage
  option](http://wahlnetwork.com/2013/10/14/three-example-home-lab-storage-designs-using-ssds-spinning-disk/).
  For me I’ve decided to go with VSAN, the hard part is figuring out the
  hardware!
