- Jeff Wouters has [a handy script to find empty Active Directory
  groups](http://jeffwouters.nl/index.php/2013/11/powershell-function-to-find-groups-with-not-users-as-members/).

- Another good one from Jeff Wouters, this time [to find the users in the
  "authoritative groups"](http://jeffwouters.nl/index.php/2013/11/powershell-function-to-list-users-in-authorative-groups-in-active-directory/).
  I believe the authoritative groups Jeff is referencing are the BUILTIN
  groups.

- If you are looking to play tricks on your coworkers or have a legitimate
  reason to eject the CD-ROM drive, [PowerShell Magazine have you
  covered](http://www.powershellmagazine.com/2013/11/12/pstip-ejecting-and-closing-cdrom-drive-the-powershell-way/).

- Jeffery Hicks at The Lonely Administrator has posted [the PowerShell
  scripts he uses to clean out his TEMP
  files](http://jdhitsolutions.com/blog/2013/11/powershell-clean-up-tools/).
  I'm a big believer in reading scripts to keep your language skills sharp
  so even if you have no need for the functions it is a worthwhile read.

- This is more of a fun/aesthetic one from Jeffery Hicks, "[Friday Fun:
  Theme Me Up!](http://jdhitsolutions.com/blog/2013/11/friday-fun-theme-me-up/)".
  If you've ever wanted to make some changes to the look of ISE, Jeffery
  will show you how. I always recommend doing some theming work, it
  teaches you a lot about a language and the execution environment.
