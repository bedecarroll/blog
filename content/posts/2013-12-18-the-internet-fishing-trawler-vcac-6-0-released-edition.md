- I’m very happy to see that vCAC 6.0 is out and it looks much nicer to
  install now, being a vApp and all. I’d recommend have a read of the
  [release notes on the VMware website](https://www.vmware.com/support/vcac/doc/vcloud-automation-center-60-release-notes.html).
  When I get a chance I hope to put it through its paces in my lab.

- Over at ElasticSkies there is [a good blog post on the new release
  detailing the new features](http://elasticskies.com/vcac-6-0-ga/). I was
  surprised by the number of hypervisors supported by vCAC 6.0, I wonder
  how many people really run multi-hypervisor environments?

- Tom Fojta has a very useful blog post on [how to generate and replace
  the self signed certificates](http://fojta.wordpress.com/2013/12/12/vcac-6-how-to-generate-signed-certificates/).
  Replacing certificates always seems to be a pain but this looks pretty
  easy. I know VMware have been putting a lot of effort into making
  certificate replacement much easier.

- To help out with the Windows install side, VMware have released [a
  PowerShell prerequisite checking script](http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2013/12/vmware-vcloud-automation-center-6-pre-req-automation-script.html).
  This should come in handy, I wish more vendors would do this!

- For those of you with existing vCAC deployments be warned that there is
  currently no migration path. VMware have released [a KB advising there
  is an automated migration path in the works for some time
  2014](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2065819). A bit of a bummer!
