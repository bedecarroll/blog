* Cisco have announced their Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI)
    initiative. Over at the Cisco Data Center and Cloud blog they have
    [a post that details where it fits into their overall strategy](http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/is-your-data-center-ready-for-aci-transformation/).

* Still at the Data Center and Cloud blog there is
  [another post that details some of the partners that Cisco have lined up for ACI](http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/application-centric-infrastructure-aci-includes-strong-partner-ecosystem-for-security-and-network-services/).
  I'm guessing these are all companies that don&#8217;t compete with
  Cisco directly (e.g. now that ACE is dead f5 are free to partner).

* Speaking of f5, as part of ACI they&#8217;ve announced support or
    compatibility between it and the f5 Synthesis &#8220;SDAS&#8221;
    architecture. Thankfully there is some kind of &#8220;detail&#8221; in the
    form of
    [a solution overview](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns340/ns517/ns224/ns945/solution-brief-c22-730004.html).
    I really want to start seeing more technical detail though, but I have a
    feeling this is all way to new and it just doesn&#8217;t exist.

* For a bit of outside perspective, SDN Central have been covering the
    announcement and have an article,
    [&#8220;Is Cisco&#8217;s SND Architecture Really That Special?&#8220;](http://www.sdncentral.com/news/is-cisco-sdn-architecture-really-that-special/2013/11/).
    It is always good to hear outside the echo chamber.

* Thankfully SDN Central again rides to the rescue with
    [some more background and detail on Insieme/Nexus 9k](http://www.sdncentral.com/news/insieme-revealed-last-policy-fabric-course-new-switches/2013/11/).
    This looks to be another one of those attempts by Cisco to short-circuit
    their seemingly bizarre internal politics where each BU have their knives
    out for the competition and each other. I wonder how many more of these
    spin-ins Cisco can really do before customers start questioning all the
    new non-compatible architectures that each one brings.
