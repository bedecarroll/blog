- For those using Nested ESXi, Andreas Peetz over at VMware Front
  Experience [shows how you can use his great tool to turn the ESXi
  VMware Tools into a package suitable to put inside the
  installer](http://www.v-front.de/2013/11/vmware-tools-for-nested-esxi-and-how-to.html).
  I’ve requested that they consider releasing the VIB as a bundle to make
  it even easier.

- Jonathan Medd has a blog post with his [Puppet module “skeleton” creator
  using PowerShell](http://www.jonathanmedd.net/2013/11/creating-a-puppet-module-folder-structure-with-new-puppetmodule.html).
  Even if you aren’t interested in Puppet you might enjoy reading some
  PowerShell.

- Over at DailyTech they have [a great article on MRAM and various memory
  architectures and the current industry state of
  play](http://www.dailytech.com/Coalition+of+20+Tech+Firms+Backs+MRAM+as+Potential+DRAM+NAND+Replacement/article33826.htm).
  Well worth the read and I think it will be an interesting time for
  hardware in the next few years.

- More general IT news, unfortunately [OCZ has gone
  bankrupt](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7549/ocz-files-for-bancrupty-toshiba-offers-to-buy-the-assets).
  They were one of the pioneers of consumer SSDs so it will be a bit sad
  to seem them go even if their drives of late were of questionable
  reliability.

- Over at Technodrone there is [an awesome series on how to use the Puppet
  Razor module](http://technodrone.blogspot.com/2013/11/installing-razor-yes-new-version.html).
  This is something I’d love to get a chance to try out in my lab when I
  get a chance.
