I seem to be on a bit of a Puppet kick as of late. Of a night I’ve been
watching the many awesome videos of the 2013 PuppetConf and I found this one
quite interesting. To me this pattern shows the future of deploying vendor
supplied applications and I’m sure all sysadmins will be eternally grateful.

I just wish the presentation had been allowed to finish. :(
