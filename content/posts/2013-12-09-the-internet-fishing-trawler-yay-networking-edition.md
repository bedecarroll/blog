- Over at Network Janitor, Kurt Bales has [a fantastic blog post on the
  “py-junos-eznc” Python library](http://www.network-janitor.net/2013/11/on-python-networks-and-the-py-junos-eznc-library/).
  It uses NETCONF for communication. Not everything out there uses REST
  APIs it seems…

- Speaking of programming, [Cisco have announced their GitHub repo for the
  new Nexus 9k series](http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/cisco-nexus-9000-community-on-github/).
  Well worth the look and I look forward to seeing it build out over time.

- Still at Cisco, the “Data Center and Cloud” blog has [a post on Cisco
  Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM)](http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/automated-fabric-provisioning-using-cisco-prime-dcnm/).
  Could be interesting.

- Over at the Cisco Security blog there is an interesting post on
  “[Operational Security Intelligence](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/operational-security-intelligence/)“.
  There is a veritable gold mine of information in your logs, think about
  DNS queries alone!

- Over at LoveMyTool there is [a post on ActionPacked Networks’ LiveAction
  tool](http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2013/11/a-visual-mental-model-of-your-cisco-network-topology-byjohn-smith.html).
  I’ve never used it but I’ve seen it at places like Cisco Live! and it
  looks like it could be quite handy in large networks.
