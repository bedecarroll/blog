- [New versions of the Dell iDRAC have a feature to auto-lock the OS when the last
  virtual console has disconnected](http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/b/techcenter/archive/2013/10/31/automatic-system-lock-feature.aspx).
  I think this is pretty useful and I’d like something like this inside VMware
  but it is obviously more important for physical servers.

- [John Allspaw at the Kitchen Soap blog has a really great post on being a senior
  engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/). This
  is one of those articles that I think everyone should read. I hope to live up
  to what is described in that post.

- [Still at the Kitchen Soap blog, John has a great post on the Knight Capital
  case](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2013/10/29/counterfactuals-knight-capital/) that
  I’ve posted about before. This is one of those posts where you’re going to want
  to get a little quiet time to read.

- [James D. Brown has an interesting piece at Wired on the role of security in
  the new DevOps paradigm](http://www.wired.com/insights/2013/10/mythbusting-devops-and-security/).
  I’m a firm believer in DevOps as I think it helps get IT where it needs to be,
  as a fast and powerful business enabler.

- [It appears that the Microsoft policy on disk duplication has been updated as
  this KB has popped up in my RSS feeds](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314828).
  Not sure what has changed (I think they’ve just updated the Applies To section
  for the new Windows versions) but I’m sure some will find this a handy link
  that they will need to refer to.
