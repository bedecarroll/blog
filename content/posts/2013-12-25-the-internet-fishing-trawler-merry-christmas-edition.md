- One to look out for those of you with IIS based websites, [Update
  decreases the page load time of web sites that are hosted on Windows
  7-based and Windows Server 2008 R2-based web
  servers](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2684600).

- I’m sure we’ve all see the trust relationship error with Windows
  computers however KB 2914472 details that [this can be caused by an IIS
  issue](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2914472). A hotfix is referenced.

- For you Hyper-V and SCOM users (though I suppose if you use Hyper-V you
  have to use SCOM) there is [a new version of the Hyper-V Management
  Pack Extensions for R2](http://blogs.technet.com/b/askcore/archive/2013/12/10/hyper-v-management-pack-extensions-2012-2012r2-available.aspx).

- I’m a bit late to posting this but over at Daniel’s Tech Blog there is
  [a post with links to all the System Center 2012 R2 release
  notes](http://www.danielstechblog.de/system-center-2012-r2-release-notes/).
  The blog is in German but the names and links are in English.

- Another one I’m just getting a chance to talk about, Alessandro Cardoso
  over at Virtualisation & Management Blog has [a post detailing the
  important new features of Server 2012
  R2](http://cloudtidings.com/2013/10/19/windows-server-2012-r2-key-capabilities/).
  When Microsoft update the MCSA/MCSE exams (January 1st apparently) this
  post will come in quite handy I’m guessing.
