* Ah management devices, the soft underbelly of your infrastructure. The good
  people over at Rapid7 have been
  [doing some analysis of the IPMI implementation in SuperMicro servers](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2013/11/05/supermicro-ipmi-firmware-vulnerabilities)
  and have found a few things.
  There will be some Metasploit modules released. While SuperMicro is the
  target here, if you watch your favourite hardware vendor&#8217;s
  announcements you will see this is something they all struggle with.

* There is a
    [Microsoft Graphics Component vulnerability doing the rounds as of late](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2896666).
    While it affects older software and versions of Windows, Lync 2010 and
    2013 versions are affected on the client side.

* It feels like forever that we&#8217;ve been at the 4TB HDD level but
    [HGST have announced a 6TB hard drive](http://architecting.it/2013/11/06/6tb-hgst-helium-drive-continues-move-to-two-tier-storage/).
    I bet this will be hellishly expensive (it is airtight and using helium
    due to the lower density) so I doubt we will be filling up our NASes with
    these any time soon.

* Martijn over at Lost Domain is starting
    [a series of blog posts on VMware NSX](http://lostdomain.org/2013/10/20/vmware-nsx-general/).
    I found this very useful as it gives an overview of each component. There
    is a lot to this SDN stuff and it varies between vendors so it can be a
    little hard keeping track.

* Yet
    [more information on Cisco ACI is coming out](http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/close-peek-at-cisco-aci/).
    One thing is for sure in all of this, learn VXLAN. Wither NVGRE I guess?
