This is going to be a bit of a different &#8220;The Internet Fishing
Trawler&#8221; post in that I&#8217;ve seen quite a few interesting looking
Microsoft KBs crop up on their RSS feeds lately. So for this edition
I&#8217;ll just be presenting each KB, you can have a bit of a look at any
that may apply to your environment. Good luck!
