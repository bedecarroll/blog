* So the day has finally arrived where EMC have released the XtremeIO storage
    array. Josh Nash has
    [a great blog post on what makes up an XtremeIO system](http://jasonnash.com/2013/11/14/emc-finally-releases-the-xtremio-all-flash-array/).
    If you only read one post I&#8217;d recommend this one to get you up to
    speed on the XtremeIO.

* But it wasn&#8217;t all sunshine and unicorns for EMC, as
    [this blog post over at ArchitectingIT will attest](http://architecting.it/2013/11/19/xtremio-what-you-need-to-know/).

* Robin Harris at StorageMojo has
    [his own take on the launch](http://storagemojo.com/2013/11/08/xtremly-late-xtremio-launch-next-week/).
    I find posts on the business options that these products represent to be
    interesting, it is a bit of a dynamic time in storage!

* The StorageIOBlog has a
  [two](http://storageioblog.com/emc-announces-xtremio-general-availability-part/)
  [part](http://storageioblog.com/part-ii-emc-announces-xtremio-general-availability/)
  series on the XtremeIO with their own take.

* And last but not least, Itzik has
    [a post on the launch with videos and all](http://itzikr.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/emc-xtremio-the-story-behind-the-story/)!
    Plus there is a bit on the differences/benefits of the XtremeIO.
    I&#8217;ll be interested to see the penetration of the product in the market
    going forward, the publicity generated by an XtremeIO being used for the
    VMware Hands-On-Labs sure doesn&#8217;t hurt (although EMC part owns
    VMware&#8230;).
