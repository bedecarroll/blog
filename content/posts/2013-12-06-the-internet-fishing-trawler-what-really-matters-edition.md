- Brian Madden has [a great post on Windows desktop
  management](http://www.brianmadden.com/blogs/brianmadden/archive/2013/12/03/as-more-apps-move-off-windows-a-quot-well-managed-quot-desktop-is-worth-less-and-less.aspx).
  I'd argue that the utility of "curating" a Windows environment is no
  where near what it once was. Do we really care that all users have the
  same background or that the notification area shows all icons? I doubt
  it. Perhaps we need to quantify the cost of all these configuration
  elements? Now that would be interesting!

- The VMware PowerCLI blog has [a good post on how to use the tagging
  feature with PowerCLI](http://blogs.vmware.com/vipowershell/2013/12/using-tags-with-powercli.html).
  Unfortunately the glaring omission is the ability to create new tags
  with PowerCLI, word is it is being worked on though.

- Dell have [announced they are working on integrating Puppet into
  "Active System Manager"](http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/dell4enterprise/b/dell4enterprise/archive/2013/12/04/dell-and-puppet-labs-helping-customers-manage-their-heterogeneous-environments.aspx).
  I don't really know to much about ASM but it appears to be their
  infrastructure manager. I'll be interested to see the benefits of the
  integration.

- For those of you doing a CCIE, [Cisco have updated the CCIE Routing and
  Switching to version 5](http://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1295245).

- Still on the new CCIE R&S, IPExpert have blog post with [a breakdown on
  the changes](http://blog.ipexpert.com/2013/12/05/ccie-rs-lab-version-5-don%E2%80%99t-panic/).
