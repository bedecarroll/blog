- [It seems that the blade server market grew at a nice clip in Q3
  according to IDC](http://bladesmadesimple.com/2013/12/idc-reports-worldwide-server-market-revenues-declines-3-7-q3-2013/)
  as reported by Kevin Houston at Blades Made Simple. I wonder how long
  this will continue? With VSAN and associated technologies, blades don’t
  really make sense to me. Maybe they won’t be as big a deal as they are
  made out to be?

- I’ve been working a lot with Microsoft Word lately and quite frankly I
  hate it. I’m not sure how but I managed to stumble upon [this blog post
  by Charlie Stross giving a good history lesson on Office and detailing
  the pain it has inflicted](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html).
  Due to recently working with GitHub md files, I’m thinking one of the
  Markdown flavours would be easier to use.

- I’ve talked about the HP iLO PowerShell cmdlets before but [PowerShell
  Magazine has a good article with an overview of the
  module](http://www.powershellmagazine.com/2013/11/12/hp-scripting-tools-for-windows-powershell/).

- Still at PowerShell Magazine, they have [a good tip on how to use
  PowerShell to compress files using
  NTFS](http://www.powershellmagazine.com/2013/10/28/pstip-compress-and-uncompress-files-and-folders-using-wmi/).
  I’m a bit surprised you have to use WMI but I’m guessing the feature is
  infrequently used.

- Joel Reed at Start-Transcript has [a great PowerShell tip on how to use
  ConvertFrom-StringData to read in “ini” like configuration
  files](http://blog.start-transcript.com/2013/08/15/just-a-bunch-of-text-files/).
  I could see this coming in handy if you want to give your PowerShell
  script an “application-like” experience. Perhaps it might be useful in
  combination with scheduled tasks?
