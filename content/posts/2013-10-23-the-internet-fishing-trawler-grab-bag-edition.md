- Interesting looking tool alert. If you've ever made a change to your
  public DNS records it can seem like an eternity for the changes to
  populate. DNSYO is a nifty little tool that will poll 500 DNS servers
  showing you the propagation of your records. [Check it
  out](http://samarudge.github.io/dnsyo/)!
- Over at Packet Pushers, Eric Flores has [a good blog post on F5
  deployment types](http://packetpushers.net/stateless-routing-f5-ltm/).
  The post is designed for in-line mode but talks about the
  "load-balancer-on-a-stick" (as in router-on-a-stick) method and the
  advantages and disadvantages of that design choice. My preference would
  be in-line mode as make troubleshooting issues nicer, something which
  should be taken into account in all designs.
- Another awesome looking tool for those of you who use System Center
  Orchestrator, the ["Orchestrator Visio and Word
  Generator"](http://blogs.technet.com/b/privatecloud/archive/2013/10/04/document-your-orchestrator-runbooks-with-the-updated-visio-and-word-generator.aspx)
  tool. Pretty cool and much better than static documentation. I'm sure
  I'll get around at some point to writing a rant on how documentation is
  done all wrong but for now I believe tools like these should exist for
  all systems.
- I'm a huge fan of Security Onion, an Ubuntu based distribution that
  bundles some of the best security tools out there into an easy to use
  (for a security product) package. I honestly think everyone should be
  running this somewhere, the logging information that it is able to
  obtain is awesome. [To see the power have a read of this SANS ISC blog
  post by the (or one of the) creators of Security Onion, Doug
  Burks](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/IDS%2C+NSM%2C+and+Log+Management+with+Security+Onion+12.04.3/16652).
- This is less hard tech but something I found interesting. Jeff Atwood
  of Coding Horror (also StackExchange, and many others, fame) asks a
  very good question, [why does battery life on Windows devices
  suck](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/10/why-does-windows-have-terrible-battery-life.html)?
  Honestly I moved to Mac (and OSX) in 2011 and haven't looked back. I
  really find I'm not missing anything from Windows though I do miss
  PowerShell and the VIClient (going anyway so it doesn't matter).
  PowerShell I can live without day to day and it helps to keep me sharp
  in more than one language, but some things are much nicer in OSX than
  in Windows. Just my experience.
