* How are those Windows XP migration projects coming along? Well I hope! A
    new 0-day is out for XP and it hits you right in the kernel. SANS has
    [all the links and details for this one](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Microsoft+Security+Advisory+%282914486%29%3A+Vulnerability+in+Microsoft+Windows+Kernel+0+day+exploit+in+wild/17117).

* If you use SCOM 2012 R2 and Dell devices there is a new management pack
    out now. You will want to
    [head on over to the Dell TechCenter to see all the little goodies](http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/b/techcenter/archive/2013/11/27/dell-management-packs-now-support-microsoft-system-center-2012-r2.aspx).

* I tend to rebuild my lab vCenter pretty often and now that I use the Nexus
    1000v I think these awesome notes from Vallard at Vallard's Tech
    Notes on
    [how to reconnect to an orphaned n1kv will come in handy](http://benincosa.com/blog/?p=808).
    Definitely one to keep around.

* If you manage/work with BGP you should be aware of the issues around
    prefix hijacking. The is heading towards RPKI and Cisco has worked with a
    large portion of the prefix owners in Ecuador to deploy RPKI and have
    [a blog post on the event](http://blogs.cisco.com/perspectives/securing-critical-internet-infrastructure-a-rpki-case-study-in-ecuador/).
    Very interesting and I hope this jumpstarts RPKI adoption.

* Over at ComputerWorld there is
    [an article on some of the various configuration management tools available](http://news.idg.no/cw/art.cfm?id=D21968B0-EE1C-1249-85D672B34C0DA5BB).
    It seems pretty good and tries to be fair to all the vendors. Obviously
    when it comes time to make a choice you will need to perform your own
    testing to see what fits your environment but articles like these help. It
    sure seems like these configuration management tools are proliferating.
