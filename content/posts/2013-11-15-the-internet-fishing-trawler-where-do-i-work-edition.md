* John Herbert over at Lame Journal has
  [an interesting post asking what network engineers will be doing](http://lamejournal.com/2013/11/06/why-wont-have-a-job-in-5-years/)
  in five years time.
  For all the worry about automation there will still be people pressing
  buttons, just fewer of them. This might be a problem if you view IT as a
  job and not a career.

* Chuck Hollis has
    [a bit of background on VMware+OpenStack](http://chucksblog.emc.com/chucks_blog/2013/11/vmware-and-openstack-better-together.html).
    I think it is all pretty cool and if you have a spare 45 minutes I&#8217;d
    really recommend doing the Project NEE (VMware HOL) OpenStack lab.

* Over at Blades Made Simple, Kevin Houston has updated
    [his great blade comparison chart](http://bladesmadesimple.com/2013/11/comparison-of-x86-blade-servers/).
    If you are comparing blades this will be a big help.

* Just a heads up,
  [turns out Windows 7 and Windows 8 roaming profiles (both are version 2)](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2887239)
  are incompatible.
  Microsoft has released a hotfix for the Windows 8 computers. Honestly I
  really dislike roaming profiles as there always seems to be some issue
  with them but if you use them you will want this patch.

* Backdoor attempts are always very interesting, you have to be subtle with
    your attack. Back in 2003 there was an attempt to modify wait4 to give you
    UID0 privileges. Thankfully due to the power of open source it was
    stopped. Ed Felten has
    [a great write up on the incident](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/the-linux-backdoor-attempt-of-2003/).
    I wonder how many are lurking out there&#8230;
